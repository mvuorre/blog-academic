I completed a PhD in Psychology at Columbia University in 2018. I am now a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia, where I study human information processing and metacognition. I want to find out why we believe some things but not others, how confidence in those beliefs is formed, what drives our curiosity to learn more, and how all this works in today's hyper-connected, digital world. To study these topics, I use behavioral experiments, electroencephalography, and statistical modelling.
